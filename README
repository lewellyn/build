This is the framework used to build SVR4 packages for Tribblix.

The primary script is dobuild, which unpacks a tarball, runs configure
and make. Then genpkg will create a package.

dobuild xrestop-0.4
genpkg TRIBxrestop xrestop-0.4

You need to create a directory for each package. Minimally, this must
contain a pkginfo fragment. There is optionally a depend file with
package dependencies (the autodepend script can help generate that
list). If any SMF services should be restarted on package
install/removal, list them in a restart_fmri_list file. And if you want
to modify the proto area, add a fixit script.
