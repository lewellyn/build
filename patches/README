Tribblix build patches

There are several sorts of patches here.

The name (including version) of a package is referred to as $PKG below

1. Source patches

If there is a file

$PKG.pls

then each line represents a patch that will be applied. The first entry
on each line is the strip argument to the patch program (generally
-p1); the second is the name of the patch file in this directory.

The patches are applied in the unpacked package directory.

2. Pre-configure patches

If there is an executable script

$PKG.preconf

then it will be run before configure. This might be used, for example,
to download additional dependencies.

3. Post-configure patches

If there is an executable script

$PKG.postconf

then it will be run after configure and before make. This is to fix up
any dynamically generated files that configure creates.
