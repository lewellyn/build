Tribblix build patches

There are two sorts of patches here.

The name (inclduing version) of a package is referred to as $PKG below

1. Source patches

If there is a file

$PKG.pls

then each line represents a patch that will be applied. The first entry
on each line is the strip argumanet to the patch program (generally
-p1); the second is the name of the patch file in this diresctory.

2. Post-configure patches

If there is an executable script

$PKG.postconf

then it will be run after configure and before make. This is to fix up
any dynamically generated files that configure creates.
